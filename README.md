# This project is from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy. So it's not my own but I'm gonna keep adding more and more to it.

## This app helps you to add your workouts and save them. I'm not done yet with this app I will improve it and add more features.

## By using the Leaflet library the map was rendered, and this project depends entirely on OOP. I hoped that you can read the code and edit it if you want, so I did some refactoring to make my code looks a bit cleaner.

### Actually what makes me want to upload this project and any project that's not mine, is that after understanding the code and following the tutorials, I used to implement the whole code from scratch again by myself, and in this one, Jones told us to add new features ourselves so I added some features like:

#### 1- Delete a workout.
#### 2- Delete all workouts.
#### 3- Edit a workout.
#### 4- Rebuild the objects that come from local storage.
#### 5- Add more realistic error and confirmation messages instead of just showing an alert.
#### 6- Sort workouts by a certain field, but I found out that is not useful so I deleted it
